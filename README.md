## 앞으로의 과제

Here are some ideas to improve the application:

-   Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
-   Add support for nicknames.
-   Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as they press enter.
-   Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
-   Show who’s online.
-   Add private messaging.
-   Share your improvements!
